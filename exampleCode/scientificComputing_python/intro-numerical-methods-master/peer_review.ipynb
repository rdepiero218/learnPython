    "# Peer Review Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing a peer review give the code a look over and think about the questions below.  Giving a couple of sentences for each of the questions is sufficient.  Code examples are even better!\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Easy to read and understand?\n",
    "   - Are the `doc-strings` useful?\n",
    "   - Are variables and functions named descriptively when useful?\n",
    "   - Are the comments helpful?\n",
    "1. Does the code follow a consistent style?\n",
    "   - Is there a consistent style? [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)\n",
    "1. Is the code written succinctly and efficiently?\n",
    "   - Was there superfluous code sections?\n",
    "   - Was the code written clearly?\n",
    "   - Was the code written elegantly without decreasing readability?\n",
    "   \n",
    "Make sure to suggest **constructive** ways to improve all of the above along with:\n",
    " - Clever ways to use built-in functionality (when appropriate)\n",
    " - Simpler ways to implement the same functionality\n",
    " - General improvements to structure, style, and naming\n",
    " - Be courteous to the person you are reviewing!\n",
