      "In the ideal mathematical world, operations like $1+2=3$, $4\\times 3 = 12$, $(\\sqrt{2})^2 = 2$ are unambiguously defined, however, when one is representing numbers in a computer, this is no longer true. The main reason of this is the so-called *finite arithmetic*, what is the way in which a computer performs basic operations. Some features of *finite arithmetic* are stated below:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Only integer and rational numbers can be exactly represented.\n",
      "- The elements of the set in which arithmetic is performed is necessarily finite.\n",
      "- Any arithmetic operation between two or more numbers of this set should be another element of the set.\n",
      "- Non-representable numbers like irrational numbers are approximated to the closest rational number within the defined set.\n",
      "- Extremely large numbers produce overflows and extremely small numbers produce underflows, which are taken as null.\n",
      "- Operations over non-representable numbers are not exact.\n",
      "\n",
      "In spite of this, defining adequately the set of elements in which our computer will operate, round-off methods can be systematically neglected, yielding correct results within reasonable error margins. In some pathological cases, when massive iterations are required, these errors must be taken into account more seriously.\n",
