      "When a new planet is discovered, there are different methods to estimate its physical properties. Many times is only possible to estimate either the planet mass or the planet radius and the other property has to be predicted through computer modelling.\n",
      "\n",
      "If one has the planet mass, a very rough way to estimate its radius is to assume certain composition (mean density) and a homogeneous distribution (a very bad assumption!). For example, for the planet [Gliese 832c](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliese_832_c) with a mass $M= 5.40 M_{\\oplus}$, if we assume an earth-like composition, i.e. $\\bar \\rho_{\\oplus} = 5520\\ kg/m^3$, we obtain:\n",

      "$$R_{g832c} = \\left( \\frac{3 M_{g832c}}{ 4 \\pi \\bar\\rho_{\\oplus} } \\right)^{1/3} \\approx 1.75 R_{\\oplus}$$\n",
      "\n",
      "That would be the planet radius if the composition where exactly equal to earth's.\n",
      "\n",
      "A more realistic approach is assuming an internal one-layer density profile like:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$\\rho(r) = \\rho_0 \\exp\\left( -\\frac{r}{L} \\right)$$\n",
      "\n",
      "where $\\rho_0$ is the density at planet centre and $L$ is a characteristic lenght depending on the composition. From numerical models of planet interiors, the estimated parameters for a planet of are $M= 5.40 M_{\\oplus}$ are approximately $\\rho_0 = 18000\\ kg/m^3$ and $L = 6500\\ km$.\n",

      "Integrating over the planet volume, we obtain the total mass as\n",
