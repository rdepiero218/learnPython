      "Nevertheless, a greater number of subintervals will imply a harder computational implementation per iteration. In other words, the number of iterations for a given precision is lower, but the computing time per iteration is higher. This push-and-pull situation is very interesting to analyse as there is not a clear answer about which scenario is more favorable, and it even depends on the number of subintervals $N$."
