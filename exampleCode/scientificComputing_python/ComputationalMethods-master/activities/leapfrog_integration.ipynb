      "The classic two-body problem with central force can be considerable simplified if one of the bodies has a mass much greater than the other one. In this case, the position of the most massive body (with mass $M$) will coincide with the center of mass of the system, and thus it is only interesting to find the position of the less massive body (with mass $m$) regarding the center of mass. The equation of motion for the body $m$ is then:\n",
