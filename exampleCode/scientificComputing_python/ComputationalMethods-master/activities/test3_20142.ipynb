      "The Henon-Heiles system is a very used non-linear system of equations to illustrate the emergence of Hamiltonian Chaos by the mechanism of unfolding of torus. It was initially conceived by Michael Henon and Carl Heiles when working on the motion of stellar systems around a galactic centre where the motion is confined to a plane. The potential of the system is given by:\n",

      "The parameter $\\lambda$ is usually taken as $\\lambda = 1$. The Hamiltonian of the system is then given by:\n",
