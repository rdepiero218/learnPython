    "As mentioned in class, bisection is a very simple and basic algorithm that finds roots of functions and exploits the [intermediate value theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_value_theorem). \n",
    "\n",
    "The error of this method is obtained by means of a geometric analysis. Considering that successives iterations bisect the previous interval into two new ones, where one of them will be chose as the interval for the next iteration, the convergence of the method is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p_n = p + \\left(\\frac{1}{2^n}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Following this reasoning from a pure mathematical point of view, modifying this scheme, such that three or even more intervals are taken in each iteration instead of two, would produce a convergence as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p'_n = p + \\left(\\frac{1}{N^n}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $N$ is the number of intervals to be considered. It is clear, then, that the greater is the value $N$ the faster the convergence is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, a greater number of subintervals will imply a harder computational implementation per iteration. In other words, the number of iterations for a given precision is lower, but the computing time per iteration is higher. This push-and-pull situation is very interesting to analyse as there is not a clear answer about which scenario is more favorable, and it even depends on the number of subintervals $N$."
